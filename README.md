# GoProxy

GoProxy is a Golang-based proxy API designed to serve as an intermediary between our clients and backend API services. By leveraging GoProxy, we can enhance the security, performance, and manageability of our private API ecosystem. Whether we're dealing with multiple microservices or a single backend service, GoProxy provides a unified entry point with powerful capabilities.

## Features

### Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect our backend services from abuse and ensure fair usage by implementing rate limiting.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Track and analyze traffic with built-in logging. Integrate with monitoring tools to gain insights into API usage and performance.
- **Request Validation**: Ensure that incoming requests meet predefined criteria before they reach our backend services.

### Performance
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend instances to ensure high availability and optimal performance.
- **Caching**: Reduce latency and backend load by caching frequent responses.
- **Connection Pooling**: Manage and reuse connections efficiently to handle high volumes of traffic with low overhead.

### Manageability
- **Unified API Gateway**: Simplifying our architecture by consolidating multiple API endpoints into a single gateway.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Route requests dynamically based on configurable rules, allowing flexible backend service management.
- **Middleware Support**: Extending functionality with custom middleware to handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, authorization, and logging.

### Disabled but can be switched Functionalities
- **ETCD**: For the leader election
- **GarbageCollectionStats**: Garbage collection statistics
